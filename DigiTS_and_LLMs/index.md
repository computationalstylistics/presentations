# Welcome to the LLM Extravaganza!


## What's an LLM?

- <span style="color:red">**L**</span>arge
- <span style="color:red">**L**</span>anguage
- <span style="color:red">**M**</span>odels

Think of it as a super-smart robot that understands and generates human
language. But instead of being a Terminator, it's more like a friendly
chatbot with a PhD in linguistics.

> *Fun Fact:* LLMs can write poetry, solve math problems, and even tell
jokes (though sometimes the jokes are as bad as mine).


## Why Should You Care?

- **Linguists:** Ever wanted a tool that can analyze vast amounts of text
in seconds? LLMs got you covered.
- **Computer Scientists:** Imagine training models that can understand
context and generate coherent responses. Mind-blowing, right?

> *Fun Fact:* LLMs can help you write better code comments (or at least try
to).


## The Magic Behind the Curtain

- **Training:** Feeding LLMs with tons of text data.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Teaching them specific tasks like translation or
summarization.
- **Inference:** Making predictions based on what they've learned.

> *Fun Fact:* Training an LLM is like teaching a toddler to talk, but the
toddler has read every book in the world.

## What to Expect Today

- **In-depth Talks:** On various applications of LLMs.
    - Eleri Aedmaa & Kristel Uiboaed (EKI), _Advancing Language Resources: Infrastructure, Data Collection at Scale, and Benchmarking Strategy_.
    - Kairit Sirts (UT), _Improving Estonian Language Capabilities in Open LLMs: Opportunities and Challenges_.
    - Mark Fišel (UT), _Large Models, Small Data_. 
- **Q&A Session:** To clarify any doubts you might have.
- **Round Table Discussion:** Meet fellow enthusiasts and experts.

*Fun Fact:* You might even learn how to teach an LLM to write a conference
paper (just kidding... or am I?).

## authorship note

- the 6 final slides were produced by a model
    - `mistral-small` 20b
    - run locally on a laptop
    - 24Gb of RAM sufficient to run it
    - `ollama` interface involved
