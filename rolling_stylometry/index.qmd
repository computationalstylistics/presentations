# Authorship attribution





## Non-traditional authorship attribution

Given:

* a text of uncertain or anonymous authorship, and
* a comparison corpus of texts by known authors,

is it possible to find the **'nearest neighbor'**
among the available candidates?







## Example: _Prometheus Bound_

* Aeschylus known for his 7 tragedies
* _Prometheus Bound_ somewhat odd, and thus disputed
* Traditional arguments against Aeschylus' authorship
    * Zeus depicted as a cruel tyrant
    * slightly different versification patterns
    * the third actor needed in one of the scenes




## Stylometry: where it (usually) begins

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(stylo)
load("greek_drama_freqs.RData")
round(greek_drama[1:19,1:10], 3)
```




## Table of computed distances

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
round(as.matrix(dist.delta(greek_drama)), 4)[1:19,1:5]
```



## Hierarchical cluster analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = greek_drama, gui = FALSE, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## Multidimensional scaling

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = greek_drama, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "MDS", titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## Bootstrap consensus tree

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = greek_drama, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "BCT", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 1000, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```
