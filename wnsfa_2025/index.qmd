# introduction



## First, what CLS is about

* Computational Literary Studies
* Aimed at analyzing (large amounts of) textual data...
* ... by computational techniques




## theoretical foundations

- "Computation into criticism" (John Burrows)
- "Algorithmic criticism" (Steve Ramsay)
- "Distant reading" (Franco Moretti)
- "Macroanalysis" (Matt Jockers)
- "Riddle of literary quality" (Karina van Dalen-Oskam)




# text analysis


## text analysis: two approaches

- focusing on the content
    - what my corpus is about?
    - how to "read" through a large library
    - approaches: topic modeling, keywords analysis
- focusing on stylistic similarities
    - why my texts form groups?
    - how to detect different stylistics "signals"
    - approaches: multivariate text classification methods




## why text analysis?

* authorship attribution
* forensic linguistics
* register analysis
* genre recognition
* gender differences
* translatorial signal
* early vs. mature style
* style evolution
* detecting dementia
* ...



## What makes them different?

text A:

    I have just returned from a visit to my landlord - the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow!


text B:

    OF MANS First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill
    Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,


## how to compare a set of texts?

* extracting valuable (i.e. countable) language features from texts
  * frequencies of words üëà
  * frequencies of syllables
  * versification patterns
  * distribution of topics
  * ...
* comparing these features by means of multivariate analysis
  * distance-based methods üëà
  * neural networks
  * ...



## from words to features

## from features to representations

## from representations to similarities


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(stylo)
data(galbraith)
data(lee)
round(galbraith[1:19,1:8], 3)
```



## what we hope to get 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "BCT", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 1000, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## Text analysis software

- Mallet
- Gensim
- sklearn
- Excel
- Statistica
- Orange Data Mining
- JGAAP
- stylo üëà
- ...




## hierarchical cluster analysis

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 100, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```

## multidimensional scaling

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "MDS", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 100, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)

# conversion to POS-tags



## Instead of words...

It was by
your desire that I first thought of such a composition. So many years
have since past, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this
circumstance: but your desires are to me in the nature of commands;
and the impression of them is never to be erased from my memory.
Again, Sir, without your assistance this history had never been
completed. Be not startled at the assertion. I do not intend to draw
on you the suspicion of being a romance writer. I mean no more than
that I partly owe to you my existence during great part of the time
which I have employed in composing it: another matter which it may be
necessary to remind you of; since there are certain actions of which
you are apt to be extremely forgetful; but of these I hope I shall
always have a better memory than yourself. 
Lastly, It is owing to you that the history appears what it now is. If
there be in this work, as some have been pleased to say, a stronger
picture of a truly benevolent mind than is to be found in any other,
who that knows you, and a particular . . .

## it works (kind of), but...

# a meta-language


## comparing texts in different languages

* translating all the texts into a single language
* either to source language, ot to target language
* alternatively: to a meta-language
* contemporary English a convenient meta-language
* allows for immediate comparisons
* topic modeling possible


## Campanella, _Civitas Solis_ (fragm.)

Attolitur ex amplissima planitie collis ingens, super quo maior pars civitatis fundata est. At multiplices illius ambitus exponuntur ad multum spatium extra montis radices, qui ea constat magnitudine, qua civitatis diameter duo et plus milliaria continet, ut circuitus sit septem. At ex gibbositate plura capit, quam si in planitie foret. Distincta est in septem gyros ambitusve ingentes, a septem planetis nominatos, et ab altero in alterum per quatuor strata viarum intratur, perque portas quatuor ad mundi angulos quatuor spectantes. Et profecto sic aedificata est, ut si quis primum expugnaret gyrum, necesse habet duplicato labore expugnare secundum; et maiori tertium, ac semper geminare vires, laboresque. Quapropter septies expugnanda est volenti eam subiugare. Ego tamen iudicio nec primum posse occupari ambitum ita crassus est, terra plenus, munitus propugnaculis, turribus, bombardis, et fossis.

## Automated translation (gemma3n)

A vast and towering hill rises from the widest plain, upon which the
greater part of the city is founded. Its extensive circumference extends
far beyond the mountain's roots, constituting a magnitude such that the
city's diameter contains two and more thousand stadia, making its circuit
seven. It consists of several distinct ramparts, more than if it were on a
plain. These ramparts are divided into seven vast circles, named after the
seven planets, and are entered through four layers of roads, and four
gates facing the corners of the world. And it is constructed in such a way
that if one were to conquer the first circle, it would be necessary to
conquer the second with double the effort, and the third with even greater
effort, always doubling the strength and labor. Therefore, it must be
besieged seven times to subdue it. However, in my judgment, it is not
easily taken in the first place, being full of land, fortified with
ramparts, towers, bombardments, and ditches.

## Notes on the Translation

*   **"Collis ingens"**: Translated as "towering hill" to convey the
impressive scale.
*   **"Amplitissima planitie"**:  "Widest plain" is a direct translation.
*   **"Multiplices illius ambitus"**: "Its extensive circumference"
captures the idea of the city's large perimeter.
*   **"Multia spatio extra montiis raices"**: "Extends far beyond the
mountain's roots" is a literal rendering.
*   **"Stadia"**:  I've left "stadia" as it is, as it's a unit of length.
It's roughly equivalent to 185 meters (607 feet).
*   **"Gibbositate"**: Translated as "ramparts" to convey the idea of the
city's walls being uneven or having multiple levels.
*   **"Planetis nominatos"**: "Named after the seven planets" is a
straightforward translation.
*   . . . 


## Conclusions


- difficult to compare texts in different languages
- possible via a grammatical layer
- translate into a meta-language
- AI might prove helpful
- comparing both content and style, to some extent
