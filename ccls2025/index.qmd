# text analysis


## text analysis: two approaches

- focusing on the content
    - what my corpus is about?
    - how to "read" through a large library
    - approaches: topic modeling, keywords analysis
- focusing on stylistic similarities
    - why my texts form groups?
    - how to detect different stylistics "signals"
    - approaches: multivariate text classification methods



## theoretical foundations

- "Computation into criticism" (John Burrows)
- "Algorithmic criticism" (Steve Ramsay)
- "Distant reading" (Franco Moretti)
- "Macroanalysis" (Matt Jockers)
- "Riddle of literary quality" (Karina van Dalen-Oskam)




## why text analysis?

* authorship attribution
* forensic linguistics
* register analysis
* genre recognition
* gender differences
* translatorial signal
* early vs. mature style
* style evolution
* detecting dementia
* ...



## What makes them different?

text A:

    I have just returned from a visit to my landlord - the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow!


text B:

    OF MANS First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill
    Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,


## how to compare a set of texts?

* extracting valuable (i.e. countable) language features from texts
  * frequencies of words 👈
  * frequencies of syllables
  * versification patterns
  * distribution of topics
  * ...
* comparing these features by means of multivariate analysis
  * distance-based methods 👈
  * neural networks
  * ...

## from features to similarities



```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(stylo)
data(galbraith)
data(lee)
round(galbraith[1:19,1:8], 3)
```



## what we hope to get 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "BCT", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 1000, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```

# uncertainty everywhere


## risk of being overly simplistic

- fast results, especially using default parameters
- tempting to apply a tool as a simple problem-solver
- tacit assumption that statistics "tells the truth"
  - humanists tend to overestimate numbers, plots, and maps
  - hard scientists tend to underestimate language variation
- tendency to forget about uncertainty in the dataset



## word frequencies agin

> ‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.’ </br> (J. Austen, _Pride and Prejudice_)

<p>“<span style="color: red;">the</span>” = 3.52% 👈</p>
<p>“<span style="color: red;">to</span>” = 3.39%</p>
<p>“<span style="color: red;">of</span>” = 2.94%</p>
<p>“<span style="color: red;">a</span>” = 1.59%</p>
<p>“<span style="color: red;">in</span>” = 1.53%</p>
<p>“<span style="color: red;">was</span>” = 1.50%</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">. . .</span></p>


## what is a word frequency, really?

- frequency of "the" in _Pride and Prejudice_ is <span style="color: red;">3.52%</span>
- however, if we devide the text into 122 chunks of 1,000 words:
    - 2.3, 4.2, 4.4, 2.9, 3.3, 2.9, 2.6, 4, 3.5, 4.5, 2.2, 3.1, 2.8, 4, 3.3, 3.9, 2.8, 4.1, 3.3, 3.6, 3.4, 5.3, 6.1, 3.8, 3.2, 3.6, 3.8, 4.3, 2.9, 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, 4.2, 3.8, 2.8, 3.2, 4.5, 3.8, 3.9, 3.6, 3.5, 3.5, 2.4, 3.5, 3, 2.7, 1.9, 3.8, 4.8, 4.9, 4.7, 3.2, 5.8, 4.6, 2.5, 3.9, 4, 2.8, 3.4, 3.4, 6, 4.2, 3.5, 2.9, 5.4, 3.5, 3.1, 3.7, 3.5, 4.8, 2.7, 3.8, 4, 2.9, 4.3, 5.8, 3.8, 5, 5.6, 3.6, 3.8, 3.7, 4.4, 4.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2,1 etc.
- max value: <span style="color: red;">6.1%</span>
- min value: <span style="color: red;">1.9%</span>
- what is the frequency of "the", after all???


## frequency is a distribution

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
data(novels)
parsed_corpus = parse.corpus(novels)
samples4 = make.samples(parsed_corpus[[4]], sample.size = 1000, sampling = "normal.sampling")
the_4 = sapply(samples4, function(x) sum(x == "the")) / 1000 * 100
hist(the_4, main = "", xlab = "frequency of the word \"the\"", ylab = "number of samples")
```


## distribution of the word 'the'

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
dens = density(the_4)
max_y = max(dens$y)
max_x = max(dens$x)
min_x = min(dens$x)
plot(NULL, ylim = c(0, max_y), xlim = c(min_x, max_x), ylab = "density", xlab = "frequency of the word \"the\"")
polygon(dens, col = rgb(0, 1, 0, 0.3))
```


## arithmetic mean

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(NULL, ylim = c(0, max_y), xlim = c(min_x, max_x), ylab = "density", xlab = "frequency of the word \"the\"")
polygon(dens, col = rgb(0, 1, 0, 0.3))
abline(v = mean(the_4), col = rgb(1, 0, 0, 0.5), lwd = 5)
```


## point estimates?

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
freqlist = make.frequency.list(parsed_corpus)[1:1000]
freqs = suppressMessages(make.table.of.frequencies(parsed_corpus, freqlist))
stylo(frequencies = freqs, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "MDS", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 100, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```


## point estimates are misleading

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
parsed_corpus = parse.corpus(novels, sample.size = 1000, sampling = "random.sampling", number.of.samples = 15)
stylo(parsed.corpus = parsed_corpus, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "MDS", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 100, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```

## the distributions are unknown

- which features should be choosen
    - 100 most frequent words?
    - or perhaps 1,000 most frequent words?
    - or maybe character 3-grams are better?
- which parameters should be preferred
    - Cosine Delta distance?
    - Burrows Delta distance?
    - minmax distance?
- the results will always be slightly different
- . . . and the distributions are unknown


## exploring different features

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = lee, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "BCT", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 1000, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## sampling from the features


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data(galbraith)
round(galbraith[1:19,1:8], 3)
```


## General Imposters method

Testing the textual similarities of _The Sound and the Fury_:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = TRUE}
data(lee)
# getting the 8th row from the dataset (it contains frequencies for Galbraith):
my_text_to_be_tested = lee[10, 1:100]
# building the reference set so that it does not contain the 8th row
my_frequency_table = lee[-c(10), 1:100]
# launching the imposters method:
imposters(reference.set = my_frequency_table, test = my_text_to_be_tested)
```


# conclusions


## closing remarks 

- 'stylo' has been around for some time
- it became a _de facto_ standard in text classification
- easy to use, but sometimes too easy
- mind that statistics does not tell The Truth
- several features that are in fact distributions
- several parameters that are in fact distributions
- suggestion: use tools with care!







# thank you!
